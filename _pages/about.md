Hi there! My name is Quentin, and I'm a first-year PhD student in mental health science at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), funded by the [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.org/).

My current research interests include:
<ol>
  <li>how mental ill-health affects decision-making and learning</li>
  <li>how existing and novel interventions may also target these processes</li>
  <li>how insights into the computational underpinnings of mental ill-health can be used to help guide clinical decisions</li>
</ol> 

Feel free to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/qdercon) to keep up to date with my work, or get in touch directly via the email icon at the bottom of the page.
