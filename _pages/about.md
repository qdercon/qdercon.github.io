Hi there! My name is Quentin, and I'm a PhD student studying [mental health science](https://www.mentalhealthscience.org/), based in the [Applied Computational Psychiatry lab](https://acplab.org/) at UCL.

My current research interests include:
<ol>
  <li>how treatments for mental ill-health alter learning and other cognitive processes</li>
  <li>how we can formalise the mechanisms of individual components of psychological and pharmacological interventions</li>
  <li>how mechanistic insights can be used to predict responses to treatments and personalise clinical decision-making</li>
</ol> 

Feel free to follow me on <b>[X](https://twitter.com/qdercon)</b> to keep up to date with my work, or get in touch directly via the email icon at the bottom of the page.
